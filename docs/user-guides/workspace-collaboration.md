# Workspace Collaboration Guide

## What are Workspaces?

Workspaces are shared spaces where teams can collaborate on tasks. Each workspace has:

- **Members** - Team members with access
- **Tasks** - Shared task list
- **Settings** - Workspace-specific configurations

## Creating a Workspace

1. Click **"Workspaces"** in the navigation
2. Click **"Create New Workspace"**
3. Enter:
   - **Workspace Name** (e.g., "Development Team")
   - **Description** (what this workspace is for)
4. Click **"Create"**

## Inviting Team Members

### Send Invitations
1. Open your workspace
2. Click **"Invite Members"**
3. Enter email addresses of people you want to invite
4. Click **"Send Invitations"**

### Member Roles
- **Owner**: Full control (you, as the creator)
- **Admin**: Can manage tasks and members
- **Member**: Can create and manage tasks
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

## Collaborating on Tasks

### Shared Task List
All workspace members see the same task list. You can:

- **See who created** each task
- **View task assignments**
- **Monitor progress** across the team

### Task Assignments
Assign tasks to specific team members:
1. Create or edit a task
2. Use the **"Assign to"** dropdown
3. Select a team member
4. They'll see the task in their assigned list

## Workspace Settings

### Access Controls
- **Public**: Anyone with the link can view
- **Private**: Only invited members can access

### Notifications
Configure how your team receives updates:
- **Task assignments**
- **Due date reminders**  
- **Status changes**
- **New comments**

## Best Practices

1. **Create separate workspaces** for different projects
2. **Use consistent naming** for tasks and workspaces
3. **Regularly review member access**
4. **Archive completed projects** instead of deleting
5. **Use @mentions** in task comments to notify specific members
